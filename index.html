                A few interesting things about me. When I'm not immersed in skimming through the newest LLM integrations, 
                I like to hang out with my friends, read and meditate as well as attempting to prove my public speaking skills at my local 
                Toastmasters club. I am also an avid scratch golfer and like to play in the afternoon with friends during summer.
                <br>
                <br>
                I graduated from Menlo College with a Bachelor's degree in Business Analytics May 2022, and I'm currently
                enrolled in the Master of Science, Data Science for Business, at BI Norwegian Business School graduating May 2024. I want to
                work on utilizing machine learning processes to bring greater value to firms. I've recently delved deeper into Gen AI, 
                and the economical benefits it could potentially bring to firms.

                    This project is based on Spotify's REST API, and contains two programs. The first one tries to predict whether a song will be featured on the Billboard
                    Hot 100 based on its audio features. The F1 score is 0.33, and was concluded to be difficult for even the more complex classification models. The precision score is 0.22, so 
                    it would not be feasible to use this in a real business setting. The other program recommend songs based on content-based filtering, again solely based on audio features given
                    by the Spotify API.

                </a>
                <p>
                    I made a notebook that predicts the ranking of a university based on its previous year's ranking.
                    The program is aimed at university administrators that want to apply such a rating to improve their
                    ranking. The program uses ML concepts and includes a hands-on program in the last two code cells if
                    the user wants to test it out.

                    <h4>Golf Shot Simulation Prediction Program</h4>
                </a>
                <p>
                    This program is made for golfers to understand their golf shot pattern better. The golfer sends in
                    their
                    golf shot data (distance, direction, and frequency), and my program estimates where the next golf
                    shots will end up based on these previous shots. This program uses k-means-clustering to segment
                    the different areas golf shots would likely end up. In addition, the algorithm to calculate the
                    probability that a golfer will hit
                    in a specific area uses among other techniques, the angle of the club face and the golfer’s
                    competence
                    level. The program was deployed as a REST-API linked to a website I developed. This website reached
                    200 unique visitors monthly.
